# FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to X. X is a value entered by a user on
the Qt window. But for multiples of A print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the
multiples of B print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both A and B
print "FizzBuzz". A and B should be entered by a user via the main window.
